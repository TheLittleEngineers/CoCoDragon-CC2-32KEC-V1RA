# CoCoDragon-CC2-32KEC-V1RA
CC2-32K-EPROM-CARTRIDGE-Version-1-Revision-A-01.06.2013 is a 32K EPROM Cartridge for the Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 1, 2, 3 and Dragon Data Dragon computers. Notes: The CoCo 1, 2 and Dragon can only access the first 16K. The CoCo 3 can access the entire 32K, minus the 0xFFnn I/O and Vector page. Many other similar (but much improved) cartridges are forthcoming. There are much better designs in my possession and I intend to post them all, in no particular order. There is an OSHPark Page here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/DuJ4X8aM
